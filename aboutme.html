    <h2>Ironman</h2>
    <p>Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of
        weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have
        assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend James Rhodes; close associates
        Harold "Happy" Hogan; Eddie March; and (briefly) Michael O'Brien.</p>
