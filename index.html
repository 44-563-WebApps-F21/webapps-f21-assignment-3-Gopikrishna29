        <h4>Displays Algoritham<h4>
                <blockquote>In graph theory, a bipartite graph is a special kind of graph that consists of two vertex
                    sets.
                    we’ll discuss a general definition. We’ll also present an algorithm to determine whether a given
                    graph is bipartite or no.

  <h4>Algoritham   Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching<h4>
      <blockquote>The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find patterns
        in strings.A string is an abstract data type that consists of a sequence of characters. Letters, words, sentences, 
        and more can be represented as strings String matching is a very important application of computer science.
        If you’ve ever searched through a document for a particular word,then you have benefitted from string-matching 
        technology.String matching can also be used to detect plagiarism by comparing strings in document AA with strings
        in document BB.
